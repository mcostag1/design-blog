              <p>
                <h4>Purple Tree</h4>
                For our preliminary sketches we drew inspiration from many spots around campus. Including the AP dormitory, the Crum Creek, and the Purple Tree
                We based our four models off of 3 main inspirations - Alice Paul Dormitory, the Crum Creek, and the Purple tree.
                Our first model was inspired by the purple tree that is currently located outside of Sharples near the tunnel to the field house lane.
                We wanted to focus on the spiral nature of the tree and how it splits off into three main branches. After receiving feedback at our desk crit, we realized
                our first sketch/design was a bit trident-like and less tree-like than we were hoping, so we made the branches ___, which overall gave a more organic look.
                We used foam board to create the model, as it proved to be one of the easiest materials to cut curves into (and then shape them with sand paper). The material was
                also thick enough it didn't take too many layers to make the laminated representation of our tree. Ideally we would want the edges of the layers to be smooth
                so that you would barely notice them, but alas that is a bit difficult to achieve with only an exacto knife and sandpaper. We also wanted to add some unnatural aspect
                to your laminated sculpture, which can be seen by the discontinuous layer in on of the layers that sort of juts out.

                In terms of material we would likely use wood and then spray paint with a purple metalic finish.

              <h4>Crum Creek</h4>

                For our second model, we were inspired by the Crum creek. We specifically wanted to emulate some form of water movement, such as waves or ripples. We made this model
                out of balsa wood as it was relatively easy to cut and form the shapes we wanted. The balsa wood was fairly flimsy though and chipped easily for more intricate shapes
                so we kept the overall wave shape pretty simple. Ideally, with laser cutting, the overall wave formed by each 2x2in piece of balsa wood would be much smoother, and even
                more intricate with the use of Indesign.

                In terms of materials we would use, I think we would still use wood and perhaps spraypaint with a sort of gradient from top to bottom.

                            <h4>AP Dorm</h4>

                            Our next two models were inspired by the AP dormitory. We wanted to emulate the geometric shape of the building as well as the windows.
                            We used legos for our first model, since it was easy to maintain the geometric shape with lego pieces.

                            The aim for our last model was to play with the symmetry and motion. We hapazardly stuck a piece of balsa wood in the middle to move
                            pieces around, but ideally it would be a piece of wire or rod. Each rectangular frame is made from the cut out of a larger one, so all the frames
                            should (theoretically) fit perfectly within each other. This would work out better with a laser cutter, but we think the general concept was achieved.
